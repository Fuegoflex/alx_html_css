                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used for creating web pages and websites.
                Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML,<br>it helps if you know what you are writing.
                HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.The code used to 
                make them<br>visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial.For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.<br>

        <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
        
        <h2>Learning HTML with ALX</h2>
        <p>
            HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hypertext means that 
            the document contains links that allow <br>the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.A Markup 
            Language is a way that computers speak to each other to <br>control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
        </p>
        <h3>What To Avoid</h3>
        <p>
            Your code’s front-end view varies from browser to browser – you will learn more about this with advanced CSS.Do not use Microsoft Word or 
            any other word processor when writing HTML code,<br>only an HTML editor or at the very least, your machine’s built-in notepad, is suitable for the task.          
            Secondly, ensure that you’ve installed a number of different browsers such as Chrome and Firefox <br>in order to preview your upcoming creation.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic Construction of an HTML Page</h3>
        <p>
            These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create. 
           <ol>
                <li> DOCTYPE html — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.  </li>       
                <li> html — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code. </li>  
                <li> head — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs. </li>
                <li> body — This is where the content of the page goes.</li>
            
            </ol>
           
        </p>
